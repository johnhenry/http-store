##Prerequesites
Befor you deploy anywhere, you must have a mongodb server instance running somewhere.
[Mongo Lab](https://mongolab.com) provides this as a service for free.

##Installation

###Remote

####Deploy on Heroku
1. Click Here:

 [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/johnhenry/http-store)

2. Use Mongo DB credentials to fill out form and follow instructions.

The Procfile includes the verbose (-v) command line argument, so if deploying straight to heroku frome this repository and you have the [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), you may access the application's output via

```
heroku logs --tail
```

If you wish to disable this, you may modify the program (see below) and push directly to heroku.
