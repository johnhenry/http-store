#HTTP Store

HTTP Key-Value Store on top of MongoDB


##Features
- Connect to a MongoDB Instance using HTTP and Web Sockets
- Due and dequeue data in a simple


##Deploy

You can easily deploy this application to multiple environments. You can run an instance locally

###Prerequesites
Befor you deploy anywhere, you must have a mongodb server running somewhere.

###Deploy on Heroku
1. Click Here:

 [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/johnhenry/http-store)

2. Use Mongo DB credentials to fill out form and follow instructions.

The procfile includes the --verbose tag, so if deploying staight to heroku from this git repository and you have the [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), you may access the application's output via

```
heroku logs --tail
```

If you wish to disable this, you may modify the program (see below) and push directly to heroku.

###Deploy Locally

####Pre Requesites
1. Visit [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) to install node

npm install -g http-store
```

2. Run
```
http-store --mongourl=<mongo database url>
```

##API

###NOTE note on queues and stacks.
While standard HTTP Methods map well to traditional key-value store options of (GET, PUT, DELETE <=> Retrieve, Insert, Remove), this is not immediately true with queues and stacks. However, by adding a few url parameters, we can easily emulate this functionality. In fact, once could implement a full que or stack with just a subset of the methods (such as in the traditional browser where only GET and POST are allowed.)

###Standard HTTP Methods

Once Running, you may access the key-value store via standard HTTP verbs. The key is a combination collection and name. The value is the body of the request.

####__PUT__ /:collection/:key

Insert values in to the database via the __PUT__ method
Content-Type header will be stored along with object.

- Additional parameters
    - ?enqueue=false|true - set to true to enqueue item rather than replace an item (See POST)


####__GET__ /:collection/:key

Retrive values from the database via the __GET__ method
Content-Type header will be set according to requested type or stored type if not requested.

- Additional parameters
    - ?dequeue=false|true - treat item as a queue and remove value from database when retrieving. Requires option UNSAFEGET to be set true. (Works exactly like DELETE ?dequeue=true)
    - ?pop=false|true - treat item as a queue and start from end instead of the beginning. Can be combined with dequeue to work as a stack.
    - ?index=0|<uint> -  treat item as a queue and retrieve specific item by order placed in index. Can be combined with pop to start from end of stack, and dequeue to remove specific items.

####__DELETE__ /:collection/:key

Remove values (or oldest values) from the database via the __DELETE__ method


- Additional parameters:
    - ?dequeue=false|true = treat item as queue and return/remove begining item instead of deleting whole item. (see GET ?dequeue=true)
    - ?pop=false|true - treat item as a queue and start from end instead of beginning. Implies dequeue and thus works as a stack.
    - ?index=0|<uint> - treat item as a queue and retrieve specific item by order placed in index. Implies dequeue. Can be combined with pop to start from the end instead of the beginning.

####POST /:collection/:key

Enqueue values into the database as via the __POST__ method

- Additional parameters
    - ?enqueue=true|false - set to false to replace item instead of enqueueing (See PUT)


####PATCH /
Send a json object similar to the following to change settings at run time. Unset fields will be ignored.
```
{
    "CHARSET": <string>,
    "BASETYPE":<string>,
    "BODYLIMIT":<string>,
    "UNSAFEGET":<boolean>,
    "DEQUEUEINTERVAL": <unsigned integer>,
    "POPINTERVAL" <unsigned integer>,
}
```

####HEAD /:collection/:key

Similar to GET but without the value and removal is impossible. Headers remain intact.

####TRACE /:collection/:key

Responds with the user's request.

##Usage

###HTTP

####Clients

There are a number of clients that support HTTP. I use curl in the examples because it comes pre-installed on most *nix machines, but there are other [graphical] clients available such as [Advanced REST Client](http://restforchrome.blogspot.com/http://restforchrome.blogspot.com/) and [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/).

Also, please note that I haven't had any success uploading binary files through Advanced REST Client or Postman, but I have had success with curl.


#### Inserting

You may insert a request's body into the database with the following commands:

```
    PUT <server address>/<collection>/<key>

    POST <server address>/<collection>/<key>?enquque=false
```

Example: Insert an image

```
curl -X PUT <server address>/flowers/rose.jpg -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg; charset=binary" --data-binary @/full/path/to/http-store/example/rose.jpg
```
(Note the "@")

#### Retrieving

You may insert a request's body into the database with the following commands:

```
    GET <server address>/<collection>/<key>
```

Example: Retrive an image

```
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/flowers/rose.jpg > newrose.jpg
```

You can also attach the "?index" parameter to indicate which index to remove and "?pop=true" to start counting from the end of the list. Finally, you may add "?dequeue=true" to remove a single item as you retrieve it


#### Enqueueing


You may enqueue a into the database item with the following commands:

```
    POST <server address>/<collection>/<key>

    PUT <server address>/<collection>/<key>?enquque=true
```

Example: Enqueue successive images

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/flowers/list -H "Content-Type: image/png; charset=binary" --data-binary @/full/path/to/http-store/example/daisy.jpg

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/flowers/list -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg; charset=binary" --data-binary @/full/path/to/http-store/example/rose.jpg
```

#### Dequeueing

You may insert a request's body into the database with the following commands:

```
    GET <server address>/<collection>/<key>?dequeue=true
    DELETE <server address>/<collection>/<key>?dequeue=true
```
(Note: This will only work for the GET method if you have the UNSAFEGET option set.)


Example : Dequeue successive images

```
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/flowers/list?dequeue=true > rose.jpg

curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/flowers/list?dequeue=true > daisy.jpg

```

You can also attach the "?index" parameter to indicate which index to remove and "?pop=true" to start counting from the end of the list.

#### Removing

You may remove all items at a key with the following commands:

```
    DELETE <server address>/<collection>/<key>
```

Example: Remove all images

```
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/flowers/list

```
Appending "?dequeue=true" will remove and return a single item from the list.
Appending the "?index" parameter to indicate a specific index to dequeue, "?pop=true" to start counting from the end of the list.


###Web Sockets

####Client

There are a number of clients that support Web Sockets HTTP. I use wscat, in the examples because it's easy to install. But there other [graphical] clients available such as [Advanced REST Client](http://restforchrome.blogspot.com/).

#####Installing wscat
If you have node and npm installed, you may install wscat with the followiing commmand:

```
npm install --g ws
```

####Connecting
You may connect using the same url as your server

```
<server address>/<collection>/<key>
```

Depending on your client, you must attach one of the following protocols (or their secure counterparts) to the beginning of the server address. If one doesn't work, try the other.

```
ws:// (or wss://)    OR    http:// (or http://)
```



Example: Connect to a web socket

```
wscat -c http://127.0.0.1:8080/integers/primes

```

When connecting, you may attach the following attributes to a url to specify a socket's properties:

- ?binary=true    - items enqueued on this channel will be stored as binary data (See Commands)
- ?type= < string >  - items enqueued will be stored with type type (See Commands)
- ?subscribe=true - subscribes the socket to updates (See Commands)
- ?queue=true     - makes the socket a queue (See Commands)
- ?closeout= < object > - sends an item on a socket and closes it out [NOT IMPLEMENTED]

Example: Connect to a web socket with subscribe set

```
wscat -c http://127.0.0.1:8080/integers/primes?subscribe=true
>
```
Example: Connect to a web socket as a queue and immediately send three numbers

```
wscat -c http://127.0.0.1:8080/integers/primes?queue=true
>2
>3
>5
```

These may also be set with commands (See Commands immediately below.)

####Commands

You can send the following commands once connected (if not connected as a queue).

__binary__ on:< boolean > - If true, all enqueued items will be stored as binary data.

__type__ type:< string > - All data enqueued items will have the associated type.

__enqueue__ item:< object > Enqueues an item.

__dequeue__ full: < boolean > -> item:<object>
Dequeues an item. Add full parameter to get full stored objet.[Partially IMPLEMENTED]

__dequeuepeek__ [full:< boolean>] -> item:<object>
Dequeues an item without removing it. Add full parameter to get full stored objet. [NOT IMPLEMENTED]

__pop__ [full: < boolean >] -> item:<object>
Pops an item.  Add full parameter to get full stored objet. [Partially IMPLEMENTED]

__poppeek__ [full: < boolean >] -> item:<object>
Pops an item without removing.  Add full parameter to get full stored objet.
    [NOT IMPLEMENTED]

__subscribe__
Toggles socket's subscriptions attribute. Subscribed sockets will recieve an empty message when an item is added to the database through this server. Subscriber will not receive notifications for other items added through other server servers or methods.

__queue__ [type:<string> binary-on:<boolean>]

Following this command, all further messages will be saved as objects

Example: Enqueue and HTML title (set the type first)

```
wscat -c http://127.0.0.1:8080/html/snippits
>type text/html
>enqueue <h1>THIS IS A TITLE</h2>
>
```

Example: Subscribe to channel and pop last added item

```
wscat -c http://127.0.0.1:8080/html/snippits
>subscribe
   < true
>pop
   < <h2>Chapter 2<h2/>
```
